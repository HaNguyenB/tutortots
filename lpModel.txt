Here is a description of the LP which our program solves:

Given n tutors and m tutees, we define the following variables:

x_{i,j} = 1 if tutor i is paired with tutee j
          0 else
    for i=1 to n, j=1 to m

d_{i,j} = absolute difference between the number of tutees assigned to tutor i and the number of tutees assigned to tutor j.
